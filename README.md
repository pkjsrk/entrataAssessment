1. I have worked created a hybrid automation framework that combines Page Object Model (POM), Data-Driven Testing, and TestNG. It is built using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG for managing test execution, and Maven for dependency and build management.

2. Test scripts and data are well organized â€” we follow a layered structure with base classes for setup, page classes for element locators and actions, test classes for validations, and utility classes for reusable functions like properties file data or taking screenshots.
